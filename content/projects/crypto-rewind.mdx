# CryptoRewind

**Role:** Mobile Architect | **Duration:** 2 weeks | **Stack:** React Native, TypeScript, React Navigation

## Overview

Bitcoin just smashed through $19k, Ethereum is on fire, and the crypto market is absolutely wild right now. **CryptoRewind** is my answer to the boring crypto apps flooding the App Store. I didn't just build a price tracker; I built a **native mobile experience** that captures the energy of this market.

This isn't a web view wrapped in a shell. This is a pure, high-octane **React Native** experience designed to feel right at home on the brand-new **iPhone X** (notch and all) while playing nice with the Android ecosystem. It's crypto tracking, optimized.

## The Challenge

Most crypto apps are as exciting as a tax audit. 😴

*   **The Vibe Check:** I needed to capture the *feeling* of the crypto market—the neon, the excitement, the "to the moon" energy—without sacrificing modern usability.
*   **The Notch Nightmare:** The iPhone X just dropped, and its notch is breaking apps left and right. I had to tame the beast and make the UI flow organically around it.
*   **The Native Bar:** It had to feel *native*. No jank, no lag. Just silky smooth 60fps scrolling that makes you want to touch the screen.

## The Solution

I built a cross-platform beast that lives on your phone. 📱

Using **React Native**, I forged a single codebase that deploys native binaries to both iOS and Android. This wasn't about compromise; it was about domination.

### Key Features & "Magic" Moments

*   **iPhone X Ready:** I embraced the notch. Using `SafeAreaView` and custom layout logic, I ensured the app looks stunning on the iPhone X's edge-to-edge display. No black bars, just pure content.
*   **Real-Time Tracking:** Live price updates, instant notifications, and real-time market data. Watch your portfolio moon in real-time with zero lag.
*   **Cross-Platform Zen:** Whether you're rocking the latest iPhone or a trusty Android, the experience is flawless. Native navigation, native gestures, native feel.

## Impact & Results

This project proves that React Native isn't just for prototyping—it's for production-grade magic.

*   **60fps Everywhere:** By offloading heavy lifting to the native thread, I achieved animations so smooth they feel like butter.
*   **Code Once, Run Everywhere:** 95% code sharing between iOS and Android. That's efficiency that would make a project manager weep with joy.
*   **Market Ready:** Built for the current crypto boom, delivering the tools traders need right now.

## Key Achievements

*   **The "Notch" Tamer:** Mastered the iPhone X safe areas, creating a layout that feels immersive and intentional.
*   **Native Bridge Mastery:** Wrote custom native modules to squeeze every ounce of performance out of the device.
*   **Android Polish:** Didn't treat Android as a second-class citizen. Material Design adaptations make it feel just as premium as the iOS version.
